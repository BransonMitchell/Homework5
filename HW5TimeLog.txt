Time Log:

First I transfered over the methods used to read a file in from homework 4, and added a new array list to keep track of unique words in the file. (20 mins)

Then I spent time trying to figure out how to compare the files so that the number of times a word appears in the original text document would be found. This was a large problem area for me. At first I tried converting my array list into an array,
and then using for loops to check a variable against another variable in the array. This resulted in every time I ran the program each instance of a word printed out and showing to the screen. I spent about an hour trying to mess around with this 
code to get it to work. I was unable to do so. Then I spent about 30 minutes trying to get nested if statements inside of a for loop to check against the unique word array and count that way, but this also didn't work to print each unique word once to the screen
with the total number of times said word appeared in the document next to it. Finally I remembered that I could compare items from my array lists against each other and counting that way. This fixed my problem. (2 hours 15 minutes)

Then I tried using a string buffer append to write to the file, but this resulted in all of the words and numbers being smushed together, so after manipulating that for a bit to no result I decided to just write straight to the file in each loop, and create a new line
with each loop, which cleaned up the look of my output file. (30 mins)

Then I ran sorts on my lists. (5 mins)
